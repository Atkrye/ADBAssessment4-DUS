<a id="fvs-extended" class="anchor" href="#fvs-extended" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FVS Extended</h3>

<p>We decided to extend the FVS team's project, as we found it very clean and compact, with no obvious bugs. We liked their code and we aimed for increasing the readability, hence our project is thoroughly commented. Variables and methods have relevant names to their function, so confusions are avoided. We guarantee you will not spend any time wondering what a method does or why it does it that way, since all changes and well explained within the code. Our aim was extending the game following the requirements and adding without altering much its backbone, so that it is still easily understandable to teams that have chosen FVS for their third assessment (and for FVS itself). We wanted to focus our development on maintaining the core values that made us chose FVS, while also adding new functionality and improving playability. Therefore, our project allows further extension in Assessment 4.</p>

<a id="duss-new-added-functionality" class="anchor" href="#duss-new-added-functionality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DUS's new added functionality</h3>

<p>In terms of implementation novelty, we implemented our original ideas stipulated in the first assessment, together with the requirements imposed for this assessment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Obstacle system</strong>, which models real life situation of a track being under repair. When a track is blocked, the train is blocked in the station for a specific time, marked on the GUI as a sliced pizza basically. We also implemented a new resource that allows the obstacles not become a burden in the game: the engineer. Obstacles are either player-managed (hence supporting tactical moves) or they can randomly come up on a connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Miss a turn, another resource that encourages tactical moves. When a player decides to use it against the opponent, the latest cannot do anything during that turn, but to watch the progress of their trains, if they have any on the map already. No goals or resources are allocated in that turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Brand new scoring system implemented based on Dijsktra's algorithm, which takes into account the relative positions of the origin and destination of the goals, as well the intermediary stations used for bonus points, if applicable.</p></li>
<li><p>Editing of routes, which goes hand in hand with the obstacle resource. If a player's train is blocked, they now have the possibility to avoid the blocked connection and take another route to the destination; they are not stuck anymore with their initial plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Quantifiable goals, a formal requirement that now allows a wide range of goals, each with tailored scoring systems. Bonus goals can now require a player to complete them within a number of turns, using a specific resource or going through an intermediary station on their way to the destination. </p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>Goal nodes highlighting: Now nobody has to hover over 10 nodes in order to discover where that goddamn Bucharest lies (we have all been there), all of the nodes that are associated to a goal are visible.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to cancel placement of resources, a necessary feature in a strategic game. If you change your mind about using the engineer this turn, you can press Escape and not have to commit to still using it.</p></li>
<li><p>Alteration of train cursor: now you can tell where you are actually pointing and point where you actually mean to.</p></li>
</ol>
