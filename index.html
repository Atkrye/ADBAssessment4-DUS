<a id="fvs-extended" class="anchor" href="#fvs-extended" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FVS Extended</h3>

<p>We decided to extend the FVS team's project, as we found it very clean and compact, with no obvious bugs. We liked their code and we aimed for increasing the readability, hence our project is thoroughly commented. Variables and methods have relevant names to their function, so confusions are avoided. We guarantee you will not spend any time wondering what a method does or why it does it that way, since all changes and well explained within the code. Our aim was extending the game following the requirements and adding without altering much its backbone, so that it is still easily understandable to teams that have chosen FVS for their third assessment (and for FVS itself). We wanted to focus our development on maintaining the core values that made us chose FVS, while also adding new functionality and improving playability. Therefore, our project allows further extension in Assessment 4.</p>

<p>In terms of implementation novelty, we implemented our original ideas stipulated in the first assessment, together with the requirements imposed for this assessment:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Obstacle system, which models real life situation of a track being under repair. When a track is blocked, the train is blocked in the station for a specific time, marked on the GUI as a sliced pizza basically. We also implemented a new resource that allows the obstacles not become a burden in the game: the engineer.</p></li>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
